<!--

    The XMLHttpRequest Object
The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to request data from a web server.

The XMLHttpRequest object is a developers dream, because you can:

Update a web page without reloading the page
Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
Receive data from a server  - after the page has loaded
Send data to a server - in the background
