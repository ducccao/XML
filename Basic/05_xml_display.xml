   <!--

       Raw XML files can be viewed in all major browsers.

Don't expect XML files to be displayed as HTML pages.


Look at the XML file above in your browser: note.xml

Most browsers will display an XML document with color-coded elements.

Often a plus (+) or minus sign (-) to the left of the elements can be clicked to expand or collapse the element structure.

To view raw XML source, try to select "View Page Source" or "View Source" from the browser menu.

Note: In Safari 5 (and earlier), only the element text will be displayed. To view the raw XML, you must right click the page and select "View Source".

       Why Does XML Display Like This?
XML documents do not carry information about how to display the data.

Since XML tags are "invented" by the author of the XML document, browsers do not know if a tag like <table> describes an HTML table or a dining table.

Without any information about how to display the data, the browsers can just display the XML document as it is.
